ðŸ’¤ Sleepy Student Detector
The Sleepy Student Detector is a computer vision-based project designed to monitor studentsâ€™ alertness in real-time using a webcam. As online and remote learning become more common, student attentiveness has become harder to track. This system aims to address that issue by using facial landmarks and behavioral cues to detect signs of drowsiness or inattention, such as prolonged eye closure, yawning, or head tilting.

Built using Python, OpenCV, mediapipe the application continuously analyzes facial expressions and eye aspect ratios to determine whether a student is sleepy or distracted. When signs of fatigue are detected, the system can trigger an alert (sound or message) to help bring the studentâ€™s attention back to the lesson.

This tool can be useful for:

Educators who want to ensure students are actively engaged during virtual classes.

Parents looking to monitor their children during self-study sessions.

Developers exploring applications of facial recognition in education and wellness.
